----------------------------------

0x10		--		First WTPA2 firmware in the world.  Only released on maybe 5-6 early "green" samplers.
					Included all updates necessary to run new sampler hardware.  Initial uSD card initializing worked, and there was a buggy uSD sample loader that got commented out.
					Also has much faster ISRs than WTPA1, and re-incorporates test modes lost in last WTPA1 FW.
					Buttons s6 and s7 don't do anything yet.

0x11		--		Sat Jul  9 14:19:05 EDT 2011 to ???
					
0x12		--		Changes on Github made mostly in 2013 I think.

0x13		--		Added audio bootloader, application changes (pre-release) in November 2014
